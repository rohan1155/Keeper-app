# React Keeper App

This is a simple React app for keeping notes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 10 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js installation)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-keeper-app.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd react-keeper-app
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

1. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

2. You can now make changes to the code in the `src` directory. The app will automatically reload if you make edits.

3. To build the app for production, use:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This will create an optimized production build in the `build` directory.
